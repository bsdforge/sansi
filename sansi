=head1 NAME

sansi -- StripANSI; strip ANSI escape sequences/characters from text
files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<	sansi> < ANSIfied_textfile > unANSIfied_textfile

Strips ANSI from B<ANSIfied_textfile>. Where B<ANSIfied_textfile> is
the name of the textfile containing ANSI, and B<unANSIfied_textfile>
is a filehandle you've chosen for it's output (sansi redirects the
filtered output to the filename you've chosen).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<sansi> was written to strip the ANSI control sequences in files, or
output, often, but not limited to those generated by compilers. I
found it difficult to visually grope/grep the output of script(1)
sessions. Especially with the advent of clang. While it's nice to
replay the script(1) sessions to view the highlighted messages. It's
near impossible to read it inline in your favorite pager, or text
editor; Enter sansi.

=head2 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

John Marino.

It probably would have never occurred to me to release
this, except that I thought it might help him, and the other
committers. I hoped it might help him after all the [unintentional]
grief I've caused him. Thanks for your patience, John!

=head1 BUGS

Doubtful. But who knows?

=head1 TODO

Better ARG handling / filtering (sanity checking)

Add additional filters, and switches to match them.
