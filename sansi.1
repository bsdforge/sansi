.IP 
Strips ANSI from \fBANSIfied_textfile\fR. Where \fBANSIfied_textfile\fR is
the name of the textfile containing ANSI, and \fBunANSIfied_textfile\fR
is a filehandle you've chosen for it's output (\fBsansi\fR redirects the
filtered output to the filename you've chosen).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
\fBsansi\fR was written to strip the ANSI control sequences in files,
or output, often, but not limited to those generated by compilers. I found it
difficult to visually grok/grep the output of \fIscript\fR\|(1) sessions.
Especially with the advent of clang. While it's nice to replay the
\fIscript\fR\|(1) sessions to view the highlighted messages. It's near
impossible to read it inline in your favorite pager, or text editor;
Enter \fBsansi\fR.

It probably would have never occurred to me to release
this, except that I thought it might help him, and the other [FreeBSD]
committers. I hoped it might help him after all the [unintentional]
grief I've caused him. Thanks for your patience, John!
